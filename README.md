# RT_BusTracker
This project is a bit more advance compare to my previous ones. 

# technical Break down
We will be tracking a vehicle throughout different set points (which in this case can be classified as STOPS) within a map.

#In the future...

I'd like to implement multiple (# within the 3 digits) bus tracking at once or even attempt to track a plane.
